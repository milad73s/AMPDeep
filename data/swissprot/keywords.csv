KW-1064	Adaptive immunity	Protein involved in adaptive immunity. Vertebrates can develop a broad and almost infinite repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which allows vertebrates to recognize almost any potential pathogen or toxin and to mount antigen-specific responses to it. Two types of adaptive immunity systems have evolved in vertebrates in order to generate immune receptor diversity. The jawed vertebrates strategy uses the V(D)JC recombination to achieve combinatorial diversity of immunoglobulin-based B cell receptors and T cell receptors. The jawless vertebrate strategy uses the somatic rearrangements of variable leucine-rich cassettes in the variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). The hallmarks of an adaptive immune system is the production of antigen-specific recognition receptor by somatic gene rearrangement. The long life of some antigen-primed cytotoxic lymphocytes and plasma cells provide protective memory to prevent reinvasion.	Biological process

Two types of diabetes insipidus are recognized: central or neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus which is due to defects in the neurohypophyseal system and results in a deficient quantity of anti-diuretic hormone being produced or released; nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a vasopressin unresponsive condition of polyuria and hyposthenuria.	Disease
KW-0219	Diabetes mellitus	Protein which, if defective, causes diabetes mellitus, a disorder of impaired carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism due to insufficient secretion of insulin or to target tissue insulin resistance. Diabetes mellitus can be divided into two main types, type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and type II, or non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Type I diabetes mellitus normally starts in childhood or adolescence and is caused by the body's own immune system which destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Classical features are polydipsia, polyphagia and polyuria, due to hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis. Type II diabetes mellitus normally starts in adulthood and is caused by a lack of sensitivity to the body's own insulin. It is usually characterized by a gradual onset with minimal or no symptoms of metabolic disturbance. Both forms of diabetes mellitus lead to secondary complications (notably cardiovascular, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy). Two other major subcategories of diabetes mellitus are gestational diabetes and diabetes secondary to other medical conditions. In common usage, the term diabetes, when used alone, refers to diabetes mellitus and not diabetes insipidus.	Disease

KW-1259	Evasion of bacteria-mediated translation shutoff by virus	Viral protein that counteracts the translation shutoff set up by the bacterial host in order to inhibit viral replication. This antiviral defense system alters a crucial cellular process thereby blocking virus multiplication and ending up with host dormancy or even cell death.

KW-0399	Innate immunity	Protein involved in innate immunity, an inborn defense mechanism used by organisms to defend themselves against invasion by pathogens (bacteria, fungi, viruses, etc.). Initially discovered in insects which are devoid of an adaptive immune system and rely only on innate immune reactions for their defense, this immediate response accomplishes many activities including recognition and effector functions. Recognition is mediated by broad specificity, pattern recognition, receptors which recognize many related molecular structures (e.g. polysaccharides, polynucleotides) present in microorganisms but not found in the host. The innate responses include the release of antimicrobial peptides, production of cytokines, acute-phase proteins, complement. Although many different innate immune mechanisms are deployed for host defence, a unifying theme of innate immunity is the use of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors for pathogens or damaged self components, such as the Toll-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like RNA helicases and C-type lectin receptors.

For example, Bor and Lom outer membrane proteins encoded by bacteriophage lambda modify the virulence of the host bacteria against a eukaryotic target. Some enteric bacterioviruses direct alterations in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, resulting in bacterial immune evasion of its eukaryotic target. Other prokaryotic viruses encode exotoxins changing their host bacteria into serious pathogens. A well-known bacterial exotoxin encoded by a provirus is the diphtheria toxin.	Biological process

These proteins are classified in a limited number of families based on the chemical structure of the light-absorbing chromophores involved, and also on protein sequence similarities to discriminate the many photoreceptor proteins that bind a flavin derivative. Accordingly, the most important families are the rhodopsins, the phytochromes, the xanthopsins, the cryptochromes, the phototropins and the BLUF proteins.	Molecular function
KW-0601	Photorespiration	Protein involved in a light-dependent process to convert 2-phospho-glycolate (2-PG) into 3-phospho-D-glycerate (3-PG), where oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide released. It takes place in plants and cyanobacteria during the light period, since in the presence of O(2) their type of Rubisco can catalyze the oxidative fragmentation of ribulose 1,5-biphosphate to 3-PG and 2-PG. 2-PG inhibits the Calvin cycle enzyme triose-phosphate isomerase, and so must be eliminated quickly. In plants 2-PG is recycled to 3-PG via reactions in peroxisomes, mitochondria as well as chloroplasts. For every 2 molecules of 2-PG, one molecule of 3-PG is formed and one molecule of CO(2) is lost. In cyanobacteria it seems there are two mechanisms to deal with 2-PG; a path similar to that described for plants and the bacterial-like glycerate pathway.	Biological process

KW-0943	RNA-mediated gene silencing	Protein involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing. This term describes a number of related processes which use 21- to 25-nucleotide RNAs to repress the expression of specific target genes. These processes include the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by either RNA interference (RNAi) or endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) and the transcriptional regulation of mRNA by RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing. RNAi is generally triggered by the presence of dsRNA produced by bidirectional transcription or by the transcription of an inverted repeat or hairpin sequence. dsRNA is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of around 21 nucleotide which are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which cleaves mRNAs with sequences fully complementary to the siRNA. miRNAs differ from siRNAs principally in their biogenesis. miRNA genes encode precursors with complex hairpin structures which are processed by endonucleolytic cleavage to form mature miRNAs. Like siRNAs, miRNAs function in RISC-like complexes. Animal miRNAs generally inhibit translation of target mRNAs following imperfect base pairing to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), while most plant miRNAs show nearly precise complementarity to coding regions of target mRNAs and trigger mRNA degradation similar to siRNAs. Finally, in RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing, siRNAs derived from repeat element transcripts are incorporated into the nuclear RNAi-induced initiator of transcriptional silencing complex (RITS), where they guide chromatin modifications such as histone methylation which lead to transcriptional silencing.

Immune complexes can be deposited in glomeruli, skin, lungs, synovium, mesothelium, and other places. Many SLE patients develop renal complications.	Disease
KW-1279	T cell receptor	The T cell receptor (TCR) is the antigen receptor expressed on CD4-positive and CD8-positive T lymphocytes that recognizes complexes of peptides bound to self-MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Structurally, TCR is composed of a heterodimer of two disulfide-linked transmembrane polypeptide chains designated alpha and beta, each containing one terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like variable domain, one Ig-like constant domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic region. A less common type of TCR, composed of gamma and delta chains, is found on a small subset of T cells and recognizes different forms of antigens.

These electrons are transferred to the respiratory chain via a C-type cytochrome.	PTM
KW-0825	Tumor antigen	Protein on the surfaces of tumor cells detected by cell-mediated immunity. Different categories of tumor antigens which induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro and in vivo, have been identified. These are, namely, "cancer testis" (CT) antigens expressed in different tumours and normal testis, melanocyte differentiation antigens, point mutations of normal genes, self antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues and viral antigens.	Molecular function
KW-0043	Tumor suppressor	Protein that suppresses tumorigenesis. Tumor suppressors generally function as negative regulators of cell cycle progression or cell proliferation. They may act to enforce cell cycle arrest in response to specific signals, such as DNA damage, thereby allowing DNA repair to occur prior to DNA replication. Tumor suppressors that act in this way include TP53 and its downstream effector CDKN1A/p21. They may also act to induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to specific developmental signals or under circumstances where DNA repair cannot be completed. Tumor suppressors that act in this way include PTEN and BAX.	Disease

The responder is typically a DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription. Several of these systems are quite complex, involving many proteins in a signaling cascade or contributing to several responses simultaneously. They are involved in a variety processes such as chemotaxis, osmoregulation, magnesium transport, pH tolerance, sporulation, or response of virulent species to host cell's environments.	Biological process
KW-0827	Tyrosine biosynthesis	Protein involved in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. In microorganisms and plants, tyrosine is synthesized from chorismate via a simple pathway using prephenate as an intermediate. In rat, this nonessential amino acid is produced by hydroxylating the essential amino acid phenylalanine.	Biological process
KW-0828	Tyrosine catabolism	Protein involved in the degradation of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine. In mammals, tyrosine degradation is catalyzed by a series of 5 enzymatic reactions which yield acetoacetate (ketogenic) and the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate (glucogenic).	Biological process

Many of these kinases play significant roles in development and cell division. Tyrosine-protein kinases can be divided into two subfamilies: receptor tyrosine kinases, which have an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, a transmembrane domain and an extracellular ligand-binding domain; and non-receptor (cytoplasmic) tyrosine kinases, which are soluble, cytoplasmic kinases.	Molecular function
KW-0830	Ubiquinone	Protein which interacts with ubiquinone. This fat soluble benzoquinone has a long isoprenoid side chain, which varies in length depending on the species. For example, S.cerevisiae has CoQ-6, E.coli has CoQ-8, rat and R.capsulatus have CoQ-9 and S.pombe, G.suboxydans and humans have CoQ-10. Ubiquinone is a carrier of hydrogen atoms (protons plus electrons) and functions as an ubiquitous coenzyme in redox reactions, where it is first reduced to the enzyme-bound intermediate radical semiquinone and in a second reduction to ubiquinol (Dihydroquinone; CoQH2). Ubiquinone is not tightly bound or covalently linked to a protein complex but is very mobile.	Ligand
KW-0831	Ubiquinone biosynthesis	Protein involved in the synthesis of ubiquinone which involves the conversion of chorismate into 4-hydroxy-benzoate, to which is added six to ten isoprene units to form polyprenyl phenol. The addition of a further oxygen atom at C3, followed by the transfer of three methyl groups from S-adenosine methionine gives rise to ubiquinol, which is further reduced to ubiquinone (6-polyprenyl-2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone).	Biological process
KW-0832	Ubl conjugation	Protein which is posttranslationally modified by the attachment of at least one ubiquitin-like modifier protein, such as ubiquitin, SUMO, APG12, URM1 or RUB1.

PTM
KW-0833	Ubl conjugation pathway	Protein involved in ubiquitin-like modifier processing, activation, conjugation or deconjugation such as Ubl-activating enzymes (E1s), Ubl-conjugating enzymes (E2s), Ubl-protein ligases (E3s), some thiol proteases (Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases (UCH), Ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBP) and ubiquitin-like proteases) and the ubiquitin-like modifier proteins. Besides signaling proteolysis, ubiquitination for example can be a signal for trafficking, kinase activation and other nonproteolytic fates.	Biological process
KW-0834	Unfolded protein response	Protein involved in the unfolded protein response. An accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen triggers a stress response, resulting in the transcriptional induction in the nucleus of a set of genes, whose products are involved in protein folding, assembly and modification as well as in phospholipid biosynthesis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is the intracellular pathway that mediates signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus. UPR is also tightly linked to ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). UPR is a ubiquitous mechanism observed in all eukaryotes from humans to yeast.	Biological process
KW-0835	Urea cycle	Protein involved in the urea cycle. This is a metabolic pathway in which ammonia, produced during amino acid degradation, is converted to urea in the liver, through a series of reactions that are distributed between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol.	Biological process

There are three clinical subtypes: Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1), characterized by congenital profound deafness, constant vestibular dysfunction, and prepubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa; Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2), associated with moderate to severe hearing loss, normal vestibular function, and onset of retinitis pigmentosa during the second decade of life; and Usher syndrome type 3 (USH3), characterized by progressive hearing loss, variable vestibular function, and adult onset retinitis pigmentosa.	Disease
KW-0926	Vacuole	Protein related to the vacuole of a cell. The precise form and function of vacuoles may vary between phyla. Plant vacuoles are among the best characterized. They are generally large fluid-filled compartments in the cytoplasm, bounded by a membrane called the tonoplast; individual vacuoles can fuse to form larger species. Examples include the lytic vacuole, the storage vacuole and the lutoid. One important function of plant vacuoles is the maintenance of hydrostatic pressure. Other eukaryotes employ vacuoles for a variety of purposes, including storage (as in the yeast lysosome/vacuole), secretion and phagocytosis. In Protozoa, contractile vacuoles can be used to discharge water from the cytoplasm to the external environment. Aquatic microorganisms may employ gas vacuoles (composed of clusters of inert gas vesicles) to provide buoyancy.	Cellular component

KW-1233	Viral attachment to host adhesion receptor	Virion surface protein implicated in the initial binding to a specific host adhesion molecule. Adhesion receptors can be for example proteoglycans, sialic acids or a protein receptor. This initial attachment is not sufficient for triggering virus entry into host cell. In prokaryotic viruses, the primary attachment is called reversible adsorption.	Biological process
KW-1161	Viral attachment to host cell	Viral surface protein implicated in the binding to specific host surface molecule(s). This binding can lead to virion entry into the host cell, it can trigger signaling pathways, or it can allow the virion to be carried by the host cell to a specific organ.	Biological process
KW-1240	Viral attachment to host cell flagellum	Virion protein involved in the primary attachment to host flagellar receptor. This attachment allows the prokaryotic virus to move along the host flagellum to find its entry receptor for viral genome penetration. Some prokaryotic viruses such as bacteriophages Chi or PV22 specifically interact with their host's flagellum, move toward the base of the flagellum to come in contact with the host cytoplasmic membrane and deliver the viral genome into the host cytoplasm.	Biological process
KW-1175	Viral attachment to host cell pilus	Virion protein involved in the interaction with bacterial pili, which are retractile filaments that protrude from bacteria with 2 membranes (Gram-negative bacteria). Binding to the pilus is followed by retraction of the pilus, which translocates the bound virion to the bacterial surface and allows subsequent viral genome penetration into host cytoplasm. Bacteriophages M13, f1, fd, R17, Qbeta, Pf1, Pf3, phiKMV or phi6 for example utilize the host cell pilus as an attachment structure.	Biological process
KW-1234	Viral attachment to host entry receptor	Virion surface protein implicated in the binding to a secondary specific host surface molecule(s), which triggers the internalization of viral genome and possibly other viral components into the host cell.

KW-1187	Viral budding via the host ESCRT complexes	Viral protein which recruits the cellular ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) to mediate host-assisted viral budding. Specific motifs in enveloped viruses' proteins called late assembly domains (L-domains) are responsible for recruiting the ESCRT machinery directly or via ESCRT-associated proteins like PDCD6IP.	Biological process
KW-0118	Viral capsid assembly	Viral protein involved in the assembly of the capsid. In most cases virion assembly is spontaneous, but viruses like adenoviruses, herpesviruses, microviruses and tailed bacteriophages need the help of scaffolding proteins to assemble their capsid. Maturation steps that remove the scaffolding proteins and induce structural changes in the assembled capsid are also often part of the assembly process.	Biological process
KW-1273	Viral capsid maturation	Viral protein involved in the refolding and structural rearrangements of the procapsid shell that give rise to the more stable mature capsid structure. These maturation events occur during the intracellular capsid assembly process. In many cases, procapsid maturation is initiated by the activation of a viral protease. Most bacterial viruses as well as Herpesviruses assemble as a procapsid that mature through a massive conformational change of the surface shell.	Biological process
KW-1242	Viral contractile tail ejection system	Viral protein that constitutes the contractile ejection system carried by some tailed prokaryotic viruses such as the Myoviridae. This structure is able to penetrate the host cell envelope, to deliver the viral genome, and possibly some specific proteins, into the cell cytoplasm. A contractile ejection system is composed at least of the contractile sheath, the internal noncontractile tube, the baseplate and the terminator complex. Sheath contraction drives the rigid internal tube through the host cell envelope. Proteins of the ejection apparatus can play an active or a structural role in ejection.	Molecular function
KW-1194	Viral DNA replication	Viral protein involved in the synthesis of multiple copies of the viral DNA genome. The replicated genomes provide support for further viral transcription or are assembled into progeny virions.	Biological process
KW-0261	Viral envelope protein	Protein of the viral envelope, a lipoprotein membrane which forms the outermost layer of the virion in certain viruses.	Cellular component
KW-1255	Viral exotoxin	Virally encoded toxin that acts as a host virulence factor against another organism. Viral exotoxins are mostly expressed from integrated viral genomes. Bacterium host, bacterial populations, and the encoding virus/provirus probably benefit from the expression of such exotoxins. Although prokaryotic viruses can kill their host if they switch to the lytic cycle, provirus encoding exotoxins (e.g. shiga toxin, diphtheria toxin) are often retained for the sake of bacterial utility.	Molecular function
KW-1249	Viral extrusion	Viral protein involved in the extrusion of viral particles from the host prokaryotic cell. Extrusion is a concerted mechanism of assembly and secretion used by filamentous phages to release mature viral particles without inducing host cell lysis.	Biological process
KW-1253	Viral genome circularization	Viral protein that is involved in or facilitates the conversion of a linear double stranded DNA viral genome into a circular form, either by homologous recombination between redundant ends or by association of complementary single stranded ends (sticky ends). Circular genomes can support rolling circle replication and, for many viruses, genome circularization is also necessary for latency.	Biological process
KW-1171	Viral genome ejection through host cell envelope	Viral protein that constitutes the ejection system carried by some prokaryotic viruses. These structures are able to penetrate the host cell envelope in order to deliver the viral genome, and possibly also some specific proteins, into the cell cytoplasm.	Biological process
KW-1250	Viral genome excision	Viral protein involved in latent provirus DNA excision from the host genome following induction. Bacteriophage lambda for example expresses an excisionase that manages excision of the viral genome from the host genome.	Biological process
KW-1179	Viral genome integration	Viral protein involved in the integration of a virus genome into the host DNA. Integrated viral DNA is referred to as a provirus in the case of retroviruses or prophage in the case of prokaryotic viruses. The integrated viral genome does not necessarily make new DNA copies of itself while integrated into a host genome. Instead, it can remain latent and be passively replicated along with the host genome and passed on to the original cell's offspring; all descendants of the infected cell will also bear it in their genomes. The host's environmental conditions changes can however reactivate the virus leading to viral transcription and production of new infectious viruses (productive infection). Integration is a crucial step in replication of retroviruses, as well as some phages. Integration is not part of the viral replication cycle of phycodnaviruses, adeno-associated virus type 2, and human herpesvirus 6A genome, but can occasionally occur.	Biological process
KW-0231	Viral genome packaging	Protein involved in actively packaging the replicated viral genome into a protective shell or envelope. Such packaging proteins are present for example in adenoviruses, herpesviruses and tailed bacteriophages. In bacteriophages, the packaging proteins complex is involved in recognizing and selecting a neo-synthesized viral genome in order to translocate it into a pre-assembled empty procapsid. DNA cleavage is sometimes coupled to genome packaging as well as maturation steps that induce structural changes in the assembled capsid.	Biological process
KW-0899	Viral immunoevasion	Viral protein involved in host immune evasion thereby optimizing viral growth and dissemination. Viral immune evasion strategies are typical of viruses which persist in their host throughout life. For example: Herpesviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae and Retroviridae have developed subversions of the MHC class I antigen-presentation pathway. In order to reduce the effectiveness of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes immunity, they express proteins that either down-modulate MHC class I expression (degradation or mislocalization) or interfere with the antigen binding/presentation process (down-regulation of the expression of the transporter associated with antigen processing TAP). Some proteins of these virus families also down-regulate other molecules involved in immune recognition.	Biological process
KW-1182	Viral ion channel	Small transmembrane protein that homo-oligomerizes to form a viral ion channel usually expressed in the viral envelope and host cell membranes. These channels affect membrane permeability to ions and play an important role in facilitating virus entry, assembly and release, as well as modulating the ion homeostasis of host cells. Viral ion channels are not necessarily required for the production of infectious virions, although their expression usually significantly increases growth. During influenza A virus entry for example, the M2 proton channel allows protons from the acidic endosome to enter the enveloped virion, initiating pH-dependent uncoating of the genome. In certain influenza A subtypes, M2 also equilibrates the intraluminal pH of the trans-Golgi network with the cytoplasm, preventing premature conformational changes in the viral fusion protein during budding.	Molecular function
KW-1251	Viral latency	Viral protein expressed primarily to establish, maintain or terminate latency, the part of the viral life cycle during which a virus lies dormant (latent) within a cell. This part of the virus life cycle is called the lysogenic part in prokaryotic viruses. During latency, the viral genome can either exist as a provirus integrated in the host genome (proviral latency) or as a linear or circular plasmid in the host cell (episomal latency). The virus does not replicate, but is passively duplicated when the host divides. In eukaryotes for example, HHV-1 and HHV-3 establish episomal latency in neurons. HIV is integrated as a provirus in the genome of resting CD4-positive T cells, allowing the virus to persist for years. Following changes in the environmental conditions of the host, reactivation of the virus can occur leading to viral transcription and production of new infectious viruses.	Biological process
KW-1276	Viral latency initiation and maintenance	Viral protein expressed primarily to establish and maintain latency, the part of the viral life cycle during which a virus lies dormant (latent) within a cell. This part of the virus life cycle is called the lysogenic part in prokaryotic viruses. During latency, the viral genome can either exist as a provirus integrated in the host genome (proviral latency) or as a linear or circular plasmid in the host cell (episomal latency). The virus does not replicate, but is passively duplicated when the host divides.	Biological process
KW-1243	Viral long flexible tail ejection system	Viral protein that constitutes the noncontractile ejection system carried by some long-tailed prokaryotic viruses such as the Siphoviridae. This ejection system is composed at least of a noncontractile tube and a tail tip which is able to penetrate the host cell envelope to deliver the viral genome, and possibly some specific proteins, into the cell cytoplasm. Proteins of the ejection apparatus can play an active or a structural role in ejection.	Molecular function
KW-0468	Viral matrix protein	Protein that organises and maintains virion structure. It usually interacts directly with cellular membranes and is involved in the budding process. In some enveloped RNA viruses, it acts as a bridge between virion membrane and nucleocapsid.	Cellular component
KW-0916	Viral movement protein	Plant viral protein that enables the viral nucleic acid to move between adjacent plant cells via the plasmodesmata.	Molecular function
KW-0543	Viral nucleoprotein	Viral protein conjugated with nucleic acid (DNA or RNA).	Molecular function
KW-0842	Viral occlusion body	Protein component of the viral occlusion body, a crystalline protein matrix which surrounds the nucleocapsids of some insect viruses (baculoviridae, entomopoxvirinae, cypovirus). Viral occlusion bodies are produced either in the nucleus (baculoviridae) or in the cytoplasm (poxvirinae and cypovirus) of the infected cells and confer resistance to adverse environmental conditions on viruses. They are made from polyhedrin (nucleopolyhedrovirus, cypovirus), granulin (granulovirus), spheroidin and spherulin (entomopox-virinae) and are dissolved by the alkaline pH of the insect gut, thus resulting in the release of infectious virus particles.	Cellular component
KW-1162	Viral penetration into host cytoplasm	Viral protein involved in the entry of the entire virion, some of its contents or at least its genetic material into the host cell cytoplasm. Entry is achieved through pore formation, membrane fusion, pilus retraction, ejection, permeabilization and/or endocytosis mechanisms. Penetration reactions occur mainly in five locations: the cell membrane, early and late endosomes, caveosomes, and the ER. In prokaryotes, membrane fusion, pore formation through a puncturing device, ejection, pilus retraction or permeabilization occur at the plasma membrane, as well as at the outer membrane in prokaryotes with 2 membranes.	Biological process
KW-1241	Viral penetration into host cytoplasm via pilus retraction	Viral protein involved in the entry of the virion into the host cytoplasm via the host pili, which are retractile filaments that protrude from bacteria with 2 membranes (Gram-negative bacteria). Entry of bound prokaryotic viruses such as filamentous viruses is achieved through the retraction of host pilus and translocation of the virion through the basis of the pilus to reach the host cytoplasm. Examples of bacteriophages which utilize the host cell pilus to penetrate into host cytoplasm are bacteriophages M13, f1, fd, R17.	Biological process
KW-1163	Viral penetration into host nucleus	Viral protein necessary for the penetration of the viral genome into the host cell nucleus either via active nuclear transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) or DNA injection through the nuclear membrane. Nuclear membrane permeabilization might also be possible. Viruses can also enter the nucleus during mitosis when the nuclear membrane temporarily disintegrates (e.g. most retroviruses). All these strategies to cross the nuclear envelope barrier are associated with various levels of capsid disassembly, since virus can pass intact (e.g. papovaviruses) or, in the case of injection, only the viral genome enters the nucleus (e.g. herpesviruses).	Biological process
KW-1174	Viral penetration via lysis of host organellar membrane	Viral membrane-lytic protein, usually associated with the viral capsid or released through partial programmed disassembly of the capsid, that induces major rupture of the bilayer integrity of host endosomal, lysosomal, or caveosomal membrane to allow viral escape and penetration into the cytoplasm. These viral lytic proteins may need to be activated, mostly through endosomal acidic pH or receptor binding to display membrane lytic activity. Viruses such as human adenoviruses group C and D lyse the host endosomal membrane to penetrate into the host cytoplasm.	Biological process
KW-1173	Viral penetration via permeabilization of host membrane	Viral membrane-penetration protein, usually associated with the viral capsid or released through partial programmed disassembly of the capsid, that locally permeabilizes the bilayer of a host membrane to allow virion penetration into the cytoplasm. Viral membrane-penetration proteins often need to be activated, mostly through endosomal acidic pH or receptor binding to display their membrane penetrating activity. Non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus, human reovirus, BDV, BTV, rotavirus, papillomavirus, Flock house virus permeabilize the host endosomal membrane to penetrate the host cytoplasm.	Biological process
KW-1181	Viral primary envelope fusion with host outer nuclear membrane	Viral protein implicated in fusion of the herpesviruses' primary envelope with the host outer nuclear membrane during egress. During egress, herpesviruses acquire a transitory, primary envelope as they bud at the inner nuclear membrane and gain access to the perinuclear space. This membrane is lost by fusing with the outer nuclear membrane during nuclear exit.	Biological process
KW-1272	Viral reactivation from latency	Viral protein involved in virus reactivation from latency to replication, thereby putting an end to the latency phase in the viral life cycle. Changes in the environmental conditions of the host often reactivate the virus leading to viral transcription and production of new infectious viruses (productive infection).	Biological process
KW-1264	Viral receptor tropism switching	A switch in the host range specificity occurs in some bacterial viruses through massive sequence variation of their host-binding receptor. Sequence variation can be induced by site-specific inversion of a DNA segment in their genome or by a diversity-generating retroelement. Inversion is catalyzed by a specific recombinase called invertase and consists of a reciprocal recombination event within two inverted repeats present in the viral genome that leads to the alternate expression of two different sets of genes involved in tail fiber biosynthesis. Mu-like viruses and P1-like viruses, for example, encode a recombinase responsible for the switch in the targeted host. Diversity-generating retroelements (DGR) like in BPP-1 virus also allow tropism switching by creating a mutant copy of an invariant DNA template repeat by transcription and reverse transcription and introducing this mutated sequence in the receptor-binding protein sequence.	Biological process
KW-1188	Viral release from host cell	Viral protein involved in the release of virions from an infected cell to allow cell-to-cell spread of virus. Once assembled at the replication site, viral particles can be released by budding, exocytosis, extrusion or host cell lysis. Some viruses also mediate direct transport of their viral genome to adjacent cells thanks to movement proteins.	Biological process
KW-0693	Viral RNA replication	Viral protein involved in the SYnthesis of multiple copies of the viral RNA genome. The replicated genomes provide support for further viral transcription or are assembled into progeny virions.	Biological process
KW-1244	Viral short tail ejection system	Virion protein that constitutes the noncontractile ejection system carried by some short-tailed prokaryotic viruses such as some Podoviridae. This ejection system is composed at least of the tail tube and ejection proteins. Upon receptor binding, proteins located inside the capsid (head) rearrange to extend the tail tube, creating a channel spanning the periplasmic space. This hydrophilic channel directs the viral genome, and possibly some specific proteins, into the cytoplasm and protects it from periplasmic nucleases. Once the viral genome is in the host cytoplasm, the channel collapses and seals. Bacteriophage T7 for example expresses ejection proteins that partition into the host outer and cytoplasmic membranes and allow transport of viral DNA across the host envelope. Proteins of the ejection apparatus can play an active or a structural role in ejection.	Molecular function
KW-1245	Viral tail assembly	Viral protein involved in tail assembly. Some tailed bacteriophages need chaperones that help with the assembly of their tail.	Biological process
KW-1246	Viral tail fiber assembly	Viral protein involved in tail fibers or spike assembly. Some tailed bacteriophages need chaperones that help with the assembly of their fibers or spikes.

KW-1228	Viral tail tube protein	Viral protein part of the virion tail tube of prokaryotic viruses such as Caudovirales. The tail tube is the channel for DNA ejection into the host cytoplasm and can be wrapped in an external contractile envelope in some viruses (e.g. Myoviridae). Also called tail shaft in some Siphoviridae.	Cellular component
KW-1195	Viral transcription	Viral Protein involved in the synthesis of messenger RNAs. The process can occur in the host cell nucleus or cytoplasm, and the genomic template can be viral DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded.	Biological process
KW-0946	Virion	Viral protein detected in the virion.	Cellular component
KW-0917	Virion maturation	Viral protein involved in the maturation of the immature virion into the mature virion, once the virion has been released from the host cell. Maturation usually involves proteolysis events and changes in the folding of the virion proteins.	Biological process
KW-0920	Virion tegument	Viral structural protein of the tegument, a protein structure that resides between the capsid and envelope of herpesviruses and which appears amorphous in electron micrographs.	Cellular component
KW-0843	Virulence	Protein involved in virulence, the degree of pathogenicity within a group or species of microorganisms or viruses, as indicated by case fatality rates and/or the ability of the organism to invade the tissues of the host. In some cases, the virulence factor can be borne by another organism in symbiosis with the one whose virulence is increased. Some prokaryotic viruses/proviruses for example bear exotoxins that increase the virulence of their host. A well-known bacterial exotoxin encoded by a provirus is the diphtheria toxin.	Biological process
KW-1164	Virus endocytosis by host	Viral protein involved in virus internalization by the host cell via endocytosis. Endocytosis can occur via: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis or clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis.	Biological process
KW-1160	Virus entry into host cell	Viral protein involved in the virion entry into a host cell. Entry is a multistep process that mostly requires binding to the target cell, penetration into the host cell cytoplasm, intracellular transport of viral components and genome release to the replication site of the virus.	Biological process
KW-0844	Vision	Protein involved in vision, the special sense by which objects in the external environment are perceived by the light they give off or reflect, which stimulates the photoreceptors in the retina.	Biological process
KW-0845	Vitamin A	Protein which interacts with any form of the fat-soluble vitamin A. There are three active forms of vitamin A: retinol, retinal (retinaldehyde) and retinoic acid, which are all derived from the plant beta-carotene (provitamin A). Vitamin A is essential to night vision and is also required for epithelium differentiation, bone development, reproduction and the immune response. Symptoms associated with a deficiency of vitamin A are night blindness, changes in the eyes, poor bone development, weak tooth enamel and dry skin.	Ligand
KW-0847	Vitamin C	Protein which contains at least one vitamin C as cofactor. This water-soluble vitamin is a reducing agent in a number of reactions. As cofactor, it is required for the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, and in many other metabolic reactions such as in the catabolism of tyrosine and the synthesis of bile acids. Deficiency in vitamin C leads to the disease scurvy.	Ligand
KW-0848	Vitamin D	Protein which interacts with any form of the fat-soluble vitamin D or protein whose transcription is regulated by the biologically active form of vitamin D, i.e. 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol) also termed calcitriol. Active calcitriol is derived from ergosterol (produced in plants) and 7-dehydrocholesterol (produced in the skin). Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) are formed by UV irradiation of ergosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, respectively, and processed by the same enzymatic pathway in the body to D2-calcitriol and D3-calcitriol. Deficiency in vitamin D leads to the disease rickets, in children, and osteomalacia, in adults.	Ligand
KW-0850	VLDL	Protein present in particles of Very Low-Density Lipoproteins or protein which interacts with them. VLDL are composed of 50% triacylglycerols, 12% cholesteryl esters, 7% free cholesterol, 18% phospholipids, and 10% proteins including apoB-100, apoC-I, apoC-II, apoC-III and apoE. Excess fatty acids or carbohydrate in the diet can be converted into triacylglycerols in the liver and packaged into VLDL. These lipoproteins are transported by the blood to muscle and adipose tissue, where activation of lipoprotein lipase by apoC-II causes the release of free fatty acids from the triacylglycerols of the VLDL.	Cellular component

They are found in various venoms from snakes, scorpions and spiders.	Molecular function
KW-0852	von Willebrand disease	Protein which, if defective, causes von Willebrand disease, a hemorrhagic disorder in which the von Willebrand factor is either quantitatively or qualitatively abnormal. Usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait though rare kindreds are autosomal recessive. Symptoms vary depending on severity and disease type but may include prolonged bleeding time, deficiency of factor VIII and impaired platelet adhesion.	Disease
KW-0897	Waardenburg syndrome	Protein which, if defective, causes Waardenburg syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by sensorineural deafness associated with pigmentary changes of the irides, hair and skin; each of these features may be uni- or bilateral. On the basis of the presence or absence of dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner corner of the eye), Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS1) and type 2 (WS2) are distinguished. Additionally, the association of WS1 with limb anomalies defines Waardenburg syndrome type 3 (WS3), while the association of Waardenburg features with Hirschsprung disease defines Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4).	Disease
KW-0853	WD repeat	Protein which contains at least one WD repeat, a conserved domain of about 40 amino acids in length. Most copies contain a central conserved Trp-Asp motif.	Domain
KW-0855	Whooping cough	Protein involved in the induction of whooping cough, a respiratory infection caused by the very small Gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by paroxysmal coughing often ending in a characteristic inspiratory gasp (whoop). The bacterium is a pathogen for humans and possibly for higher primates.	Disease
KW-0856	Williams-Beuren syndrome	Protein which, if defective, causes Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving genes from chromosome band 7q11.23. It is a rare developmental autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cardiovascular abnormalities, elfin face, mental and statural deficiency, characteristic dental malformation, and infantile hypercalcemia.	Disease
KW-0879	Wnt signaling pathway	Protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnts are a large family of cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins that control development in organisms ranging from nematodes to mammals. Wnt genes are defined by sequence homology to the original members of the family, Wnt1 in the mouse and wingless (wg) in Drosophila. Wnt signaling is a very complex pathway which includes numerous ligands, receptors and transcriptional effectors. There is a well-characterized canonical pathway as well as diverse, less-characterized noncanonical pathways. Several components of Wnt signaling are implicated in the genesis of human cancer.	Biological process
KW-0857	Xeroderma pigmentosum	Protein which, if defective, causes xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by extreme photosensitivity to ultraviolet light and the development of multiple skin cancers.	Disease
KW-0858	Xylan degradation	Protein involved in the hydrolysis of xylan to xylose and other sugars. Xylan is a major component of hemicellulose, which is the second most common plant material in nature. The structures of xylans are complex, and several enzymes are involved in their breakdown. Xylan degrading enzymes are produced by a variety of microorganisms.	Biological process
KW-0859	Xylose metabolism	Protein involved in the biochemical reactions with the 5-carbon sugars xylose or xylulose. Xylose is the second most abundant sugar found in hardwood and agricultural residues.	Biological process
KW-0861	Zellweger syndrome	Protein which, if defective, causes Zellweger syndrome, a fatal peroxisome biogenesis disorder associated with severe abnormalities in the brain, liver and kidney and death soon after birth. This disease is characterized by the presence of empty peroxisomes in the cells due to impaired transport of peroxisomal proteins into the peroxisomes.	Disease
KW-0862	Zinc	Protein which binds at least one zinc atom, or protein whose function is zinc-dependent. Zinc is a metallic trace element, chemical symbol Zn.	Ligand
KW-0864	Zinc transport	Protein involved in the transport of zinc.	Biological process
KW-0863	Zinc-finger	Protein which contains at least one zinc finger. A small, functional, independently folded domain that requires coordination of one or more zinc ions to stabilize its structure. Zinc fingers vary widely in structure, as well as in function, which ranges from DNA or RNA binding to protein-protein interactions and membrane association.	Domain
KW-0865	Zymogen	The enzymatically inactive precursor of mostly proteolytic enzymes.	PTM
